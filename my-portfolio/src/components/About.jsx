        <p>Hello! I'm Esteban Zambrano, a passionate and dedicated student with a keen interest in web development. Currently pursuing my studies in computer science, I have developed a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and modern frameworks like React and Node.js.</p>
        <p>My journey in web development began with simple HTML projects, where I discovered the joy of creating engaging and interactive web pages. Over time, I have honed my skills and expanded my knowledge to include more advanced technologies and tools. My projects showcase my ability to design and implement responsive, user-friendly, and visually appealing web applications.</p>
        <p>I am always eager to learn new things and collaborate with others to create innovative solutions. Feel free to explore my portfolio and reach out if you'd like to connect or learn more about my work.</p>
